new repo for testing github

well, this is cool. but i was expecting something inside this repo. 

NB: All I did to see this is

* search for the repo on github.com
* fork the repo to my own account
* copied the link from my account
* created a new folder
* git bash the folder
* git clone the-copied-link

But in order to make changes and push to the same linked repo, I just

* made changes to the readme
* git add .
* git commit
* git push origin master

I am now going to make a pull request to you from my github account
